# Deep-Learning-Projects - Deep Learning EPFL 2021
Authors: Andrea Oliveri, Célina Chkroun, Stéphane Nilsson

## Description
This repository contains the 2 mini-projects of Deep Learning. 

The first mini-project aims to familirize ourselves with pytorch library, test 
multiple Deep Learning models in order to resolve a defined problem and try 
interpreting and comparing the resulting nets and their performance at resolving 
the defined problem.

The second mini-project aims to better understand what pytorch or other Deep
Learning libraries do behind the scenes by recoding an entire a mini “deep 
learning framework” without using the autograd or the neural-network modules of 
pytorch.

## Folder Structure
- `Proj1`: this folder contains the Proj1. To have more details on the problem 
  to resolve, the organization of the folder and on the library dependencies
  please have a look at the README.md present in this folder.
  
- `Proj2`: this folder contains the Proj2. To have more details on the goal, the 
  organization of the folder and on the library dependencies of this project 
  please have a look at the README.md present in this folder.
